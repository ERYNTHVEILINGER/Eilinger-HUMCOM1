            <h3>PC build discussion</h3>
            <p> IF YOU'VE BEEN beating yourself up about doing nothing productive during quarantine, don't. Sometimes nothing is exactly what you need. Other times, it’s nice to make something<br> 
                with your own hands. That’s what this guide is about: how to build a PC from scratch. It can be daunting for a lot of reasons—it’s expensive, it’s complex, it can get messy. But<br> 
                I want to be clear: If you can build an Ikea table, bookshelf, bed, or anything that comes in more than one of those deceivingly heavy flatpacks, you can build a PC.<br>
                Regardless of what kind of PC you’re building (home office or gaming), the components you need are going to be the same. You’ll need a motherboard, a CPU (central processing unit),<br> 
                storage, memory, a power supply, a case, and a monitor. The only thing you might not need if you're mostly using this PC for home office tasks is a GPU (graphics processing unit), <br>
                but it's necessary for photo or video editing and gaming. That’s a lot of stuff. Here’s a little breakdown of what each component does, along with some hardware recommendations.

            <ol type='I'>
                <li>The Mother board</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, system board, baseboard, planar board, logic board, or mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers <br>
                and other expandable systems.
            </p>
            <ol type='I'>
                <li>The General Processing unit(GPU)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Graphics processing unit, a specialized processor originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering. GPUs can process many pieces of data simultaneously, making them useful for machine<br>
                learning, video editing, and gaming applications.
            </p>
            <ol type='I'>
                <li>The Random access memmory(RAM)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It is the internal memory of the CPU in the form of a hardware device located on the motherboard of a computer. ... Furthermore, RAM is a volatile memory as it can?t store data and <br>
                instructions permanently. For example, when we switch on a computer, the instructions from the hard disk are stored in the RAM.
            </p>
            <ol type='I'>
                <li>The Solid State Drive(SSD)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A solid-state drive is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, and functioning as secondary <br>
                storage in the hierarchy of computer storage.
            </p>
            <ol type='I'>
                <li>The Central processing unit(CPU)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The computer's central processing unit (CPU) is the portion of a computer that retrieves and executes instructions. The CPU is essentially the brain of a CAD system. It consists of <br>
                an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), a control unit, and various registers. The CPU is often simply referred to as the processor.
            </p>
            <ol type='I'>
                <li>The Power suply unit(PSU)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A power supply unit converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power <br>
                supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage. 
            </p>
            <ol type='I'>
                <li>The Heat sink</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A heat sink is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is <br>
                dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature.
            </p>
            <ol type='I'>
                <li>The chasis</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A computer case, also known as a computer chassis, tower, system unit, or cabinet, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a personal computer (usually excluding <br>
                the display, keyboard, and mouse).
