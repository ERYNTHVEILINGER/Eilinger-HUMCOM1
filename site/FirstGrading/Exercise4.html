            is a 3rd person anime-inspired action battle game developed by KOG Studios
             which uses Unreal Engine 4 and their system called 
            <i>Toonline</i>

            character creation and combination based action combat applicable to their wide selection of PvE

            a certain point wherein major events and stories are depicted differently.However, it is not a 
            direct sequel to their previous title although it may seem to fit the bill.

<p>
    Ancient KurtzPels, the legendary heroes of the past, were imprisoned inside the Tower of Gods during the Great Change that was caused by an evil deity. 
    However, even after 400 years of their imprisonment, the Ancient KurtzPels' will lives on through their descendants. They have created a KurtzPel organization 
    called Chase, to prevent the oppressive Holy Bellatos Empire.
</p>
<p>
    Now, as a new member of Chase, players must fight against the Bellatos Army and prevent them from spreading their religious dogma.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Development"><font color="red">Development</font></span><a class="toc-link" href="" title="Table of Contents"></a></h2>
<p>
    A demo of the game, which was still under development at the time, was presented at the GSTAR 2017 trade show. Amidst a market that is aggressively migrating 
    to mobile, Director Gwon answered that the decision to stick with PC was based on the will to uphold KOG's name in action games and the belief that quick and 
    concise controls were essential to do so. They also chose to work with an engine suitable for multiple platforms.
</p>
<p>
    When asked what kind of game KurtzPel is, the director said that it has KOG's proven action formula improved and claimed to cut out any Pay-2-Win systems. 
    He stressed that the game is an action PvP game at the core and that related content will be developed first.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Gameplay"><font color="red">Gameplay</font></span><a class="toc-link" href="" title="Table of Contents"></a></h2>
<p>
    KurtzPel is an online game where the player's character consists of three things: <b>Soul</b> (lore), <b>Body</b> (appearance), and <b>Karma</b> (weapon). 
    The character has a base set of three special skills for each weapon, bound to <b>E</b>/<b>R</b>/<b>F</b> keys, and has a "rage skill" that activates when using 
    <b>Q</b> key. The character can deliver various combos if the player chain up the base combos with skills and also have a dodge ability on <b>Shift</b>.
</p>
<p>
    The players can use an online matchmaking system to participate in various PvP Missions or fight against Epic Boss Monsters to practice their skills. The players 
    can obtain and enhance their Karma and choose up to two Karma to take to Missions. As a Chaser, they will complete Missions in various places. The more difficult 
    the Mission, the better rewards they receive. Missions are selected from the Mission Map in "Eltheca". Available missions change every day.
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Karma_System"><u><font color="red">Karma System</font></u></span><a class="toc-link" href="" title="Table of Contents"></a></h3>
<p>
    In the game, Karma acts as a class role. Each Karma requires a different playstyle that is essential to have great teamwork. It is up to individual players whether 
    they will focus on one, or be more versatile by switching Karma in battle. Also, it is something that can be shared with other users. This means it is possible to 
    possess all existing Karma which can be trained further.
</p>
<p>
    Karma has two types called <i>Slayer</i> and <i>Breaker</i>. <b>Dance of Wind</b> (longbow), <b>Diabolic Witch</b> (staff), <b>Dual Soul</b>&nbsp;(dual sword), 
    and&nbsp;<b>Ruler of Darkness</b> (scythe) focus on dealing damage. Though Slayers are vulnerable to enemies' attacks, they deliver powerful attacks. <b>Sword Taliah</b> 
    (greatsword), <b>Blazing Fist</b> (gauntlet), <b>Sacred Guardian</b> (giant hammer), and <b>Fallen Light </b>(elemental buster) on the other hand focus on interrupting 
    the enemy's attack. Though their attacks are not as powerful as Slayers, Breakers can endure more attacks.
</p>
<p>
    Players can have two active Karma at their disposal to engage in battle and switch between them with the TAB key anytime, a function similar to Dual Wielding System in 
    Grand Chase. Karma crystals can be attached to weapons and will decide their usable skills. To receive necessary equipment, talk to Heroes and raise affinity with them.
